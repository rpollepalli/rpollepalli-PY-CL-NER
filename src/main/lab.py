"""
Named entities are proper nouns that refer to specific entities. 
They can be a person, organization, location, date, etc. 
For example, in the sentence "Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft", we have three named entities.
Bill Gates and Paul Allen are two named entities, of type person, and Microsoft is the third, of type organization. 
Named entity recognition, or NER, is the process of extracting Named Entities from the text. It is used in tasks such as classifying content and content recommendation.

"""
We'll be using NLTK's ne_chunk function to detect named entities.
